# Aksu's dotfiles
Im a real programmer now mom, I have a dotfiles repo

Designed to be used as a bare git repo. If you don't know how those work (It's ok, I didn't either, its some weird black magic), read [this](https://www.ackama.com/what-we-think/the-best-way-to-store-your-dotfiles-a-bare-git-repository-explained/). Just remember to replace all the .cfg with .config
